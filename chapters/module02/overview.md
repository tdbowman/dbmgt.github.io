# Module 2: Structure of DBMS

## Overview

This week we dive into the **relational data model**—the foundation of most modern databases. You'll learn how data is organized into tables, how tables relate to each other, and the rules that keep data consistent.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Explain the components of the relational data model
- Define tables, rows, columns, and their proper terminology
- Identify different types of keys (primary, foreign, candidate)
- Describe integrity constraints and their purpose
- Apply relational concepts to real-world scenarios

## Topics Covered

1. **The Relational Data Model**
   - History and importance
   - Tables (relations)
   - Rows (tuples) and columns (attributes)
   - Domains and data types

2. **Keys**
   - Primary keys
   - Foreign keys
   - Candidate keys
   - Composite keys

3. **Integrity Constraints**
   - Entity integrity
   - Referential integrity
   - Domain constraints
