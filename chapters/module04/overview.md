# Module 4: Database Normalization

## Overview

**Normalization** is the process of organizing data to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. This week, you'll learn to identify normalization problems and apply normal forms to fix them.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Explain functional dependencies
- Identify normalization anomalies
- Apply 1NF, 2NF, 3NF, and BCNF
- Normalize a database schema

## Topics Covered

1. **Why Normalize?**
   - Insert, update, delete anomalies
   - Data redundancy problems

2. **Normal Forms**
   - First Normal Form (1NF)
   - Second Normal Form (2NF)
   - Third Normal Form (3NF)
   - Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)

## Assignments

- Normalization exercises
- Prepare for Midterm

## Readings

**Required:**
- Rob - Chapter 5 (Normalization)
