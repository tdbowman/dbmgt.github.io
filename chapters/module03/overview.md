# Module 3: Data & Database Modeling

## Overview

Before building a database, you need to design it! This week we learn **Entity-Relationship (ER) modeling**—a visual technique for designing databases before writing any SQL.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Identify entities, attributes, and relationships in business scenarios
- Draw ER diagrams using Crow's foot notation
- Determine cardinality and participation constraints
- Translate business requirements into database designs

## Topics Covered

1. **ER Modeling Concepts**
   - Entities and entity types
   - Attributes (simple, composite, derived, multivalued)
   - Relationships

2. **ER Diagrams**
   - Crow's foot notation
   - Cardinality (1:1, 1:N, M:N)
   - Participation (total vs partial)

## Assignments

- **Module 3 Discussion** - Data and DB Modeling
- Continue working on Exercise 2

## Readings

**Required:**
- Rob - Chapter 4 (Entity-Relationship Modeling)
